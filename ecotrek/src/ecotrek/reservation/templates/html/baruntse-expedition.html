                                     <b>Baruntse</b>, 7,129m one of the most beautiful Mountain located in the heart of Khumbu massif and surrounded by the some of the worldâ€™s famous mountains such as Mt. Everest, Makalu, Amadablam and Mera peaks. It is also one of the few peaks of this height with a high rate of success of climb on common route via South Ridge. To reach the base camp of the mountain, several approaches are possible. One can trek from Lukla over the Mera-La to base camp or one can trek from Tumlingtar via Makalu Base Camp. The latter approach is more demanding, because 2 high passes have to be conquered, the East Col) and West Col. The West Col is also the location of camp 1 and the start of the South-East Ridge to the summit. Base camp of this Mountain is located at the altitude of 5450m. And other two camps will be established, camp1 and camp2 on <b>Baruntse Expedition</b> around the altitude of 6100m and 6400m respectively. It would be better to know earlier about the weather condition of this mountain. The wind is the most frightening factor, and can be quite changeable, with everything from a flat calm, to hurricane force on the summit. There may be deep snow, heavy rains, mosquitoes in wet areas, blowing dust, burning heat, bright sunshine etc. The best time to visit the region is spring or autumn. Baruntse can be attempted anywhere between mid October and early November.
