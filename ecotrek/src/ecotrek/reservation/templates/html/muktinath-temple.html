                                        Muktinath is a sacred place for the pilgrimage of both religions: Hindu and Bhuddist. Muktinath Temple is located in Mustang districtâ€™ Baraha gaun, 3,710m above the sea level at the foot of the Thorong La Mountain. Mukthinath Temple is about 110km far from pokhara and 20 km far from jomsom.  The Hindus call it Muktichhetra, a place of salvation is one of the four religious sites of Hindu. This is called muktichhetra, a place of salvation because according to Hindu mythology Lord Vishnu got free from the curse of Sati in the form of shaligram. Many shaligrams (Ammonite) found in the muktinath temple premises and in the bank of Kaligandaki River. And these shaligram are considered by Hindu as incarnation of lord Vishnu and worship them faithfully.
