                                        Tsum Valley, which is located in the north of the Gorkha district, is the Himalayan pilgrimage surrounded by Buddha Himal, Himal Chuli, Ganesh Himal and Sringi Himal. There are three passes to enter the Tsum Valley: Ngula Pass, Dhoj Hyang Pass and Yamdro Pass. The word Tsum originates from the Tibetan word Tsombo which means bright or vivid. It is named as Tsombo (Tsum) as the ancient relics of theTsum Kingdom are still bright and visible. The majestic Himalayan back drop, ancient art, culture and religion make this valley one of the most interesting and beautiful trekking destination. Most of the people of this trekking route are Tibetan descendents with their unique culture and the trekkers get the opportunity to explore their original culture, tradition and religion untouched by modernity. As the region is restricted and isolated trekking route opened in 2008, the natural beauty and the original culture of this place remain intact. Tsum Valley is supposed to be the haven of spirituality, prosperity and Peace.

                                        The journey to this secluded valley begins from Aarughat Bazaar of Gorkha district where you reach after 7-8 hour drive from Kathmandu Valley. Then you follow the side of the Budhigandaki River viewing the waterfalls on both sides of the River and ascend north to the valley. It passes through the small villages like Liding, Machhakhola, Jagat and Philim enjoying the warm welcome and hospitality of the people, the narrow valley of Budhi Gandaki, and different Buddhist monasteries.  The trail offers you the chance to observe and explore diverse flora & fauna, and different ethnic people with their own unique religion and cultures. On the way you can also take bath in the natural hot springs which, it is believed, cures the skin disease. The major attractions of this trek are sacred Pigeon Cave in the Tsum valley, the majestic view ofBuddha Himal, Himal Chuli, Ganesh Himal and Sringi Himal from the valley, the beautiful song of different birds in the forest.
