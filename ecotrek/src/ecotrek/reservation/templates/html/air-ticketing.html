                                       Air Ticketing is another invincible service that we are providing to our guests since long. Within air ticketing service we included the domestic air ticketing service, international air ticketing service and mountain flight air ticketing service. Nepal is situated in geographically difficult location and most of the naturally beautiful places are in remote areas. Most of these areas are not connected by the road and those areas which are connected by the road are also difficult to reach by bus because roads are not good, it takes long time  as well as  risky. In this context domestic air flight is best option to reach and visit the beautiful remote areas of Nepal. Important places of Nepal such as Jomsom, Lukla, Pokhara, Dhangadi, Jumla, Nepalgunj, Chitwan, Bhairahawa and Biratnagar are connected by the domestic airlines. Because of limited flight and bad weather it is difficult to get domestic ticket in time especially for Lukla, Jomsom and Jumla so ticket reservation should be done in time. Different Nepalese airlines such as Buddha air, Agni air, Yeti air, Sita air, Tara air and Guna air make domestic flight in these places , we will make the reservation of these airlines as per you request.
