                                       Everest Base Camp Trek with Island Peak Climbing is one of the most adventurous trips in the Khumbu Region. Island Peak (6173m.), which is also known as Imja Tse and appears as an island in a sea of ice from Dingboche, is one of the most popular and easiest trekking peaks of Nepal. Island Peak Climbing takes you in the heart of the Khumbu or Everest Regions. Island Peak was first scaled in 1953 by Swiss team as the preparation for climbing Mount Everest. Island Peak Climbing offers the enjoyable experience of high altitude climbing with the magnificent scenery of Himalayan and glacier in the Everest region. It provides the superb panorama of the world's highest mountain Mt. Everest (8848m.) and other mountains including Lhotse (8510m.), Makalu (8463m.), Nuptse, Ama Dablam etc. Island Peak Climbing combines the trekking trail of Everest Base Camp Trek with mountaineering of trekking peak Island (Imja Tse).

                                        The real trek starts from Lukla which is 30 minutes flight from Kathmandu valley and ends at the same place. From Lukla we follow the same trail ofEverest Base Camp Trekkingor the expedition route of Everest up to Everest Base Camp. During this trek up to Everest Base Camp, the trekkers get opportunity to unite with the varieties of flora and fauna of the world heritage site Sagarmatha National Park, the unique culture and lifestyle of Sherpa people who are famous for mountaineering in the world, along with the chance to observe the world highest monastery of Buddha. The flow of Khumbu glacier, the cascading down of Dudh Koshi in glee, the view of towering mountains gives the astonishing pleasure for the climbers. You also hike to Kala Pathar (5,542m.) from where you see the wonderful view of Mt. Everest. From the Everest Base Camp, it may take two or three days to climb island peak. From Everest Base Camp you head Dingboche from where you see the peak as Island in a sea of ice to Imja valley finally to Pareshaya Gyab (5,087m.), base of the island peak. Then you climb the peak from South East Flank and South-West Ridge. From the peak you see the magnificent view of Lhotse (8,501m.) and Nuptse in the north, Makalu (8475m.) in the east, and Amadablam in the south Mountain Background.
