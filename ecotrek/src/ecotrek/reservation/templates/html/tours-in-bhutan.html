                                    <h2>Day to Day Itinerary</h2><p><strong>Day 01: Arrival at Paro (by Druk Air) - Transfer to  hotel. </strong><br />
                                    On a clear day, the flight to Paro is one of the  most spectacular of all mountain flights. You will see major Himalayan peaks  such as Everest, Kanchenjunga and Makalu, and then on the final approach to  Paro Bhutan’s  own snowy peaks, Chomolhari and Jichu Drake will come into view. Bhutan’s  first gift to you as you disembark from the aircraft will be cool, clean fresh  mountain air. After clearing customs and visa control you are met by your Bhutan  representative, and then drive you the short distance to Paro town. After lunch, visit Ta Dzong, an ancient watchtower, which now houses the National Museum. This dzong was converted into  the National Museum in 1968. The museum boasts  antique thangka, textiles, weapons and armour, household objects and rich  assortment of natural and historic artifacts. <br />
                                    We  also visit the Rinpung Dzong<strong>,</strong> built in 17th century to defend  the valley against Tibetan invaders. The dzong is now used as an administration  centre and school for monks. The evening ends with a walk through Paro’s main  shopping district. Dinner and overnight at hotel. </p><p><strong>Day 02: Paro -Thimphu</strong><br />
                                    A spectacular descent through  mountainous valleys brings you into the Kingdom of Bhutan.  The beautiful airport is your first glimpse of what's ahead. After clearing  customs and visa control you are met by your driver and guide. A short drive  along the valley brings you to Thimphu, the capital of Bhutan. This very picturesque drive  past rural homes, hillside monasteries and chortens only takes 1.5 hours.  Settle into your hotel and after lunch at a local restaurant start your  sightseeing, visiting the Textile Museum, a traditional paper making factory  and the Post office to see Bhutan's beautiful stamps which also depicts about  our country’s myths, traditions etc. Alternatively you can do less formal  sightseeing and walk around the town with your guide. Dinner at a local  Bhutanese restaurant. Overnight at Hotel. </p><p><strong>Day 03: Thimphu  valley sightseeing and hike to Tango Monastery</strong><br />
                                    After breakfast drive at  Sangaygang, a field of Bhutanese prayer flags, perched high above the city.  Colored flags send prayers to the heavens and white flags honor the dead. Visit  the Motithang Mini Zoo where you can see the National animal Takin research  centre where these odd animals graze peacefully in a small protected park. Walk  to the Zilukha Nunnery and then drive to the Tango Monastery for a picnic  lunch.The hike to the monastery takes about 45 minutes. It is a 13th Century  structure and today is home to about 150 monks studying Buddhist Philosophy and  meditation. Thimphu sightseeing continues with the Folk  Heritage Museum  (a beautifully restored Bhutanse farmhouse from the last century) and the National Painting School.  In the evening visit the National Memorial Chorten built in honor of our 3rd  king Jigme Dorji Wangchuck (a wonderful opportunity to mix with the local  population). All the buildings in Bhutan conform to national building  principals and are beautifully carved and decorated. Dinner at Royal Golf Club.  Overnight at hotel Jumolhari.</p><p><strong>Day 04: Thimphu  – Punakha</strong><br />
                                    Depart Thimpu and drive over the  Docchu-La pass to Punakha. The teahouse at the pass offers beautiful views of  the Himalayan range in the distance. This is a 3 hour drive with stops en  route. Overnight at hotel Zangto-Pelri. Afternoon visit the magnificent Dzong  spanning the MoChu and Po Chu rivers. This is the winter residence of the  monastic body and the Je Khenpo (chief Abbott). Dinner and overnight at hotel.</p><p><strong>Day 05: Punakha – Gangtey</strong><br />
                                    This morning we travel to the Probjikha Valley stopping at Wangdue en route, a  typical rural town, where locals buy and sell all manner of produce! We turn  off the main road for the Probjhika Valley, arguably the most beautiful in Bhutan.  The scenery changes dramatically and your will see dwarf bamboo and possibly  grazing yaks. Continue to the bottom of the valley and see the Black Crane  Institute and Research Centre. The migratory crane arrives in the valley in  late October each year. Dinner and overnight at hotel.</p><p><strong>Day 06: Gangtey – Trongsa -  Bumthang</strong><br />
                                    Today our drive is spectacular and  passes over many valleys. We stop at the Chendibji Chorten at the top of a  highest pass of the Black mountains and then continue into Central   Bhutan. The golden roofed Trongsa Dzong spans the valley that  divides east and west Bhutan  and is another architectural feat, which can be seen for 20 tantalising and  winding miles before it is finally reached. Afternoon visit the impressive  Trongsa Dzong and then drive to Bumthang via Yotongla pass (3,400 metres).  Enroute visit the joint Australian/Bhutanese wool project at Chumey valley.  Watch the single loom weaving process and buy yak wool rugs or scarves if you  wish. There is also a wonderful selection of textiles from all over Bhutan  on display and for sale at this roadside stop. You will probably see Yaks on  the high passes on the way to Bumthang. Eventually the road winds down into the  beautiful Bumthang valley, the cultural heart of Bhutan. Rice paddies give way to  fields of barley and potatoes as the climate is too cold for rice. Dinner and  overnight at Rinchenling Lodge. </p><p><strong>Day 07: Bumthang</strong><br />
                                    Bumthang  is said to be one of the most  spectacular valleys in Bhutan  and also the heartland of Buddhism. Here many great teachers meditated and left  in their wake many sacred grounds. The Guru and his lineage of Tertons  (treasure finders), have led to the sprouting of many temples in the valley. <br />
                                    In the morning we hike to visit Tamshing  Monastery (one of the oldest monastic schools built by Terton Pema  Lingpa) and Kurjey Lhakhang (where the Guru Rinpoche subdued a local demon  and left his body imprint on a rock). We also visit Jambay Lhakhang (one  of the oldest temple in Bhutan  built in 7th century) and Jakar Dzong (seat of the district  administration).<br />
                                    In the afternoon hike to Thangbi  valley across the suspension bridge and visit the Thangbi Lhakhang built in the  14th century. Dinner and overnight at hotel Rinchenling lodge.</p><p><strong>Day 08: Bumthang – Ura -  Bumthang</strong><br />
                                    After  breakfast, we drive to Ura valley. At a distance of 42 kilometres from  Bumthang, the road reaches the Ura Shelthangla, where there is a magnificent  view in clear view of Bhutan's  highest peak, Gangkar Puensum (7,500 m). The road then descends into Ura valley  by long loops across fields and pastures. Ura's main occupation is raising  sheep, yaks and the introduction of potato farming has brought a certain degree  of prosperity of people. We visit Ura Lhakhang and then drive back Bumthang.  Afternoon visit&nbsp; Tamshing Monastery (one  of the oldest monastic schools built by Terton Pema Lingpa) and Kurjey Lhakhang  (where the Guru Rinpoche subdued a local demon and left his body imprint on a  rock). We also visit Jambay Lhakhang (one of the oldest temple in Bhutan  built in 7th century) and Jakar Dzong (seat of the district  administration). Overnight at Rinchenling lodge.</p><p><strong>Day 09: Bumthang – Wangdue -  Punakha</strong><br />
                                    Depart the Bumthang valley and  retrace our route back out of the valley and back to Wangdue. This is a long  day's drive - a necessary evil in order to see the Festival. Dinner and  overnight at hotel.</p><p><strong>Day 10: Punakha – Thimphu – Paro</strong><br />
                                    An early  departure from Wangdue to Paro via Thimphu for  a break and a chanceto buy any textiles or artifacts that you may not have  picked up elsewhere on your travels. Afternoon drive or hike &nbsp;to Takstang (Tiger's Nest) Monastery, the most  photographed in Bhutan. The monastery has been rebuilt after a disastrous fire  destroyed it some years ago. The monastery can only be viewed from afar as it  is not open to the public. The view is however worth the steep 1 hour walk up a  wide mountain path. Wildflowers will still be in bloom. Later, visit Ta Dzong  (an ancient watchtower) which now houses the National Museum.  This dzong was converted into the National   Museum in 1968. The  museum boasts antique thangka, textiles, weapons and armour, household objects  and rich assortment of natural and historic artifacts. <br />
                                    We also  visit the Rinpung Dzong, built in 17th  century to defend the valley against Tibetan invaders. The dzong is now used as  an administration centre and school for monks. Later evening take a walk around  the main street of Paro’s main shopping district. Dinner and overnight at  hotel.</p><p><strong>Day 11: Paro – Departure (by  Druk Air)</strong><br />
                                    In  the morning our agent escort will bid you farewell at Paro airport.&nbsp;  Good-bye and happy journey back home.</p></div>
