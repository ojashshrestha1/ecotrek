                                     Mt. Lhotse is located in the Khumbu Region of Nepal, about 3km south of Mt. Everest along Nepal Tibet Border. Mt.Lhoste is considered another challenging Mountain expedition in Nepal. Mt.Lhoste and Mt. Everest share the same base camp and Mt. Lhoste is the part of Mt. Everest. Expedition on Mt. Lhoste means expedition on south face. Three peaks that make up the Lhotse massif are: Lhotse East or middle, Lhotse Shar and Lhotse. Immediately south of Mount Everest lies the long east-west crest and the summits of the two mountains are linked by the South Col. South Face of Lhotse is the most technical face of Lhotse. The Lhotse South Face is also one of the largest mountain faces in the world. Khumbu icefall is the most dangerous section on Mt. Lhoste Expedition. The trip of <b>Mt Lhoste Expedition</b> starts with a flight from Kathmandu to Lukla. After completing the 11 days trek including the places of Namche Bazar, Thyangboche, Dangboche and Lobuje you will reach to the <b>Mt. Lhostse Base Camp</b>. The trip from the base camp will be directly to the Camp 2, where climbers will spend two nights before continuing up to Camp 3 on the Lhotse Face. There will be practice ladders at Base Camp so that Members will have the chance to become familiar with how to walk across these before traveling through the Icefall for the first time Starting from Camp3 on the Lhotse face, the route follows the normal Everest trail up to the traverse over to the Yellow Band. Beyond the Yellow Band and close to the Base of the Geneva Spur, Lhotse climbers make a sharp right turn, taking them directly up a steep slope to Lhotse Camp 4. Tent spaces are cut out of this slope just beneath and to the right side of the Lhotse couloir. After passing Lhoste couloirs you will reach on the summit of Mt. Lhoste from where romantic glimpse of other Mountains can be seen.
