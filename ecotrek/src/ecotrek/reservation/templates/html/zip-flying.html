                                      <b>Zip Flying</b> is the latest addition to soft adventure activates in Pokhara. Thrill seekers can now ride a zip line and fly through the air and be rewarded with unmatched views of Machhuchhre and Annapurna, Lakes and Pokhara city. The zip line extends from Sarangkot hill to Yamdi in Hemja and offers a two minute ride at speed of up to 140km per hour. The zip rider descends 2,000ft during the flight; it’s the world’s steepest, tallest, longest and fastest zip line. <b>Zip Line</b> consists of a pulley suspended on a cable. It is designed to enable a user propelled by gravity to travel from the top to bottom of the inclined cable by holding on to, or attaching to, the freely moving pulley. The user is physically attached to the cable by a harsness which attaches to a removable trolley. Zip Flying is the newest adventure activity in Nepal and a ride costs Rs 3,890 for Nepali, Rs 5,890 for SAARC visitors and US dollar 98 for other foreign visitors. <b>Zip Flying </b>accommodates one flyer at a time.
