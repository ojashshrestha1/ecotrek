                                        Dolpo Region
                                        is distant region of Nepal and the central point of this area is Shey Phoksundo National Park. Dolpa is also one of the two districts that lie beyond the Himalaya or the trans-Himalaya, Mustang being the other. The elevation in Dolpa ranges from 1,525 to 7,625 meters above sea level. The district borders Tibet (China) in the north and northeast, Jumla and Mugu districts of Karnali in the west, Myagdi, Jajarkot and Rukum in the south and Mustang in the East.The east and south of Dolpo is surrounded by the Dhaulagiri and Churen Himal ranges and to the west by Jumla district. Trekking to Dolpo offers you the remarkable and breathtaking experience of lifetime. The notable figures seen here are snowy peaks, ancient and remote villages, rich wildlife, lovely Buddhist monasteries and wonderful lakes. The people of this area are simple and warm-hearted with enthralling culture and traditions. The cultural traditions of this area are basically linked with Tibetan.

                                        Ba-Yul, the hidden land of Dolpo, was first settled by Rokpa farmers and Drokpa nomads from Tibet in the 10th century. It is one of the highest inhabited places on earth, with scattered fortress-like villages and monasteries nestling amongst mountains of stark, ascetic beauty. Though part of Nepal today, Dolpo remains culturally and economically firmly tied to Tibet, the people of this desolate area are cut of from their southern neighbors by snow-covered passes for much of the year. This trek can also be done even in the mid monsoon as it lies in the rain shadow are formed by the Mt. Dhaulagiri and Annapurna ranges. The trek begins at the STOL airstrip of Juphal after a short flight from the terrain town of Nepalgunj which is well connected by both road and air from Kathmandu.
