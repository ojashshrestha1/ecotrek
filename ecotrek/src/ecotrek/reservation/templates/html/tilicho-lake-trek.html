                                        The challenging Trekking to Tilicho Lake (4919m.), the highest lake of the world, is a wonderful Summer Trek in the Annapurna Region. Tilicho Lake is also considered as the sacred Lake by the Hindu people as it is mentioned in the Ramayana- the holy book of the hindus, and many Hindu pilgrims visit this place every year. It receives the entire glacial melt of the northern slope of Annapurna Range as well as the Thorung Peak. Tilicho Lake Trekking is the adventurous and exciting trekking in the isolated and rugged trail of Annapurna Region which offers the majestic vistas of the mountains like Annapurna, Machhapuchhre, Manaslu, Tilicho peak etc. During the trek you enjoy the culture and tradition of different ethnic people which is similar to the Tibetan people, views of river gorges, beautiful Marsyangdi Valley, centuryâ€™s old Buddhist monastery.  The pristine natural beauty and dense forest with wildlife as well as the hospitality of the people added further pleasure to the trekkers.

                                        Tilicho Lake Trek commences from Besisahar of Lamjung District which is the starting point of other Annapurna Region Trekking. From Besisahar you walk along the bank of Marsyangdi River enjoying the panorama of Manaslu and Himal Chuli to the east as well as other mountains. In route you cross the beautiful villages inhabited by a wide diversity of people from different ethnic groups with the spectacular views of the white Himalayas. After you reach the Tilicho Lake there are two routes to return: either you can cross the challenging pass of Moesokanta La Pass to Jomsom or travel to Thorung La pass. To get full enjoyment of Tilicho Lake Trek, the best time is beginning of March to end of May and beginning of September to end of December.
