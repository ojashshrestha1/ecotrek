                                        Gokyo Valley is one of the favorite sites of Khumbu for trekkers. Gokyo Valley Trek is the outstanding opportunity to have the vistas of 8000m Himalayas like Mt. Everest, Mt. Makalu, Lhotse, Cho Oyo etc. The image of the towering view of these popular mountains which are clearly visible from GokyoRi above Gokyo Lake is an most remarkable image of this region. It also offers wonderful views of the Ngozumpa Glacier- one of the largest glaciers of Nepal. After the thirty minutes flight from Kathmandu to Lukla, the trekking really begins. From Lukla the trail goes up and follows the sides of Dudh Koshi and joins the end of Ngozumpa Glacier. This trail leads across the Khumbu Glacier- the longest Glacier of Nepal. The view of the ice ridge between Cho Oyo and Gyachung located in Khumbu Region is one of the remarkable features of this trekking route. Along the trek we will pass Buddhist monasteries with the views of Everest and other snow towering mountains getting closer by the day. During the trail one or two days rest is essential for the proper acclimatization which is very important. In the villages of Namche bazaar, we will take rest which allows us to explore the culture and tradition of the Sherpa community. We provide professional guides to help you for the Gokyo Valley Trekking whose knowledge and experience provide you opportunity to explore the amazing destination and its impressive sight, which is beyond human imagination.
