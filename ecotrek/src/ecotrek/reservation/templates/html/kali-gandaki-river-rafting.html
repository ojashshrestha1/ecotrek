                                    <p><b>Kali Gandaki River</b> is known as the river of God. The Kali Gandaki is an excellent medium length River trip made easy by the completion of the road from Pokhara to Baglung. The most commonly rafted section is from Nayapul (Baglung) to Ramdhighat (Syangja), a distance of about 100km, which will take five days to complete. The Kali is an excellent alternative to the Trisuli as there is no road alongside. And, the scenery, wildlife, villages and temples all combine to make this a great trip.</p><p><b>Rafting in Kali Gandaki River</b>, rafters can undergo the three types of experience according to the international grading of rafting. From the season of September to December rafters can take the pleasure of 4 great rafting. Similarly, from the season of January to May rafters can enjoy the -4 grade rafting. In the same way, from the season of June to August rafters can take the pleasure of +4 grade rafting. But during the season of June to August because of monsoon huge rain makes the possibility of high risk. So, one must be confident and cautious.</p><p>The rapids on the Kaligandaki are much more technical and continuous than on the Trisuli, and in high water it’s no place to avoiding big holes. Being one of the Nepal’s holiest river, every river’s junction on the kaligandaki is dotted with cremation cites and burial mounds.&nbsp;</p><p>The rafting trip in Kaligandaki River can be divided into three sections: higher, medium and lower. At Ranighat, on the lower section of the River wonderful derelict place is located which is slowly being taken over by the surrounding jungle. It is a fantastic place to stop and have a look around. Higher and medium sections have much white water but lower section does not have much white water but offers a wildlife scene and isolated area.</p>
