                                    <p>The <b>Trisuli River</b> is known as the River of classic. <b>Trisuli River Rafting</b> is one of the cheapest trips available in Nepal. The best white water can be found on the section between Baireni and Mugling, near to Kathmandu valley. <b>Trisuli River Rafting</b> can be rafted for 1 to 3 days and 15 to 60 km. Rafters can enjoy three types of international grading of rafting in the same River in three different time. From the season of September to December rafters can take the pleasure of grade 4 rafting in <i>Trisuli River</i>. Similarly, from the season of January to May rafters can enjoy the -4 grade rafting. In the same way from the season of June to August the rafters can take the pleasure of +4 grade rafting in the Trisuli River.&nbsp;</p><p>The easy access is provided by the Kathmandu to Pokhara, (prithvi highway) which runs right alongside the River.The positive aspect attached with <b>Trisuli River Rafting</b> trip - first of all Trisuli is situated near Kathmandu valley so one can go easily within three hours. Secondly, those who want short and cheap rafting trips, <b>Trisuli River Rafting</b> may be fruitful. Thirdly, during the monsoon month the Trisuli changes the character completely as huge run off makes the River swell and shear. So the garbage and excrement of the past season is well on its way to Bangladesh as topsoil. Last but not least, trips on the Trisuli can be combined with trips to Pokhara or Chitwan, in order to save time and money and to add excitement and pleasure.</p>
