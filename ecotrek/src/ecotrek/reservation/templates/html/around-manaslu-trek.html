Major inhabitants of the Manaslu Region are the Gurung people. Gurung people are very rich for their aged preserved culture, tradition and festivals so, during this trek interested trekkers can know the Gurung culture and traditions and can participate in their different festivals. This trek starts from the attractive old historical city of Gorkha, the ancient kingdom of the Shah Dynasty that has a mixed Hindu and Buddhist culture. Trek follows the bank of the Budi Gandaki River valley, crossing its rumbling waters on various types of rope and suspension bridge, passing underneath towering rock cliffs, and through dense jungle. The scenery changes each day, as trek ascend through a number of climatic zones into rocky territory. Trek joins the barren lunar landscape of the Tibetan plateau, where monasteries, temples, ch√∂rtens and Mani walls line the trail and reach to Larkya La Pass. Larkya La Pass is the highest point of the  Around Manaslu Trekwhich offers the stunning glimpse of several white capped peaks such as Lamjung Himal, Kang Guru, Annapurna, Dhaulagiri and Machhapuchhre.
