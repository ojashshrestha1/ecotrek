                                      The <b>Annapurna Mountain</b> Range is located in the North-central part of Nepal.The entire massif and surrounding area are protected within the 7,629sq.km, Annapurna Conservation Area Project, the first and largest conservation area in Nepal, established in 1986 by the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation. The <em>Annapurna Conservation Area</em> is residence to several world-class treks, including the Annapurna Circuit. The main summit stands to the west of the Annapurna Sanctuary. The mountain has glaciers on its western and north-western slopes which deplete into a great gorge cut through the Himalaya by the Kaligandaki River. Mountain Expedition in Nepal for the first time opened to the world with the victory of this Annapurna Mountain in 1949. It is 8000m high and 10th highest mountain of the world. Annapurna Mountain region spread with Lamjung Himal from the Kali Gandaki in the west to the Marshyangdi in the east. Despite the opening mountain for the Mountain expedition Annapurna is still one of the least climbed 8000m peaks.
