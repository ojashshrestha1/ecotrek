                                        language, and by experiencing the rafting in Marsyangdi you will find out why

                                        <b>Marsyangdi River</b> rises on the northern slopes of the Annapurna Himal, flows east through
                                        an arid valley around Manang, and then swings south to join the Trisuli River
                                        at Mugling .For most of the trip from Ngadi down to Bimalnagar the river is
                                        engrave as a winding gorge in to the valley floor about 50 meter deep with
                                        sloping well wooded sides. Only a few villages are visible during this
                                        river&nbsp; trip and at times you could almost be on a river in Idaho or
                                        British Columbia. As the river turns fresh views unfold behind of the Manaslu
                                        and Annapurna ranges - a magnificent backdrop. You can also view beautiful
                                        campsites.

                                        The lower<b> Marsyangdi</b> gorges from Bimal Nagar down the Mugling, used to be an
                                        excellent river trip, but now a new dam has been built own stream of Bimalnagar
                                        to generate electricity for Kathmandu. So there is almost no water left in this
                                        section of the river and it can no longer be recommended for rafting. Even though,
                                        you can enjoy rafting in other parts of <b>Marsyangdi River</b><i>.</i>
