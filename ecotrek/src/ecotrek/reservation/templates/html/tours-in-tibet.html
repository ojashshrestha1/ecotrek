                                        Tibet is located between the ancient civilizations of China, Nepal and India. It is separated from the ancient civilization of China by the wide-ranging mountains to the Tibetan Plateau and from the Nepal and India by the soaring Himalayas of Nepal and India. Tibet has got the two nicknames: the roof of the world and the land of snows. Tibet tour is famous for its culture which is the mixture of Chinese, Indian and Nepalese culture. In addition of this fact Tibetan culture developed in its own distinct way because of Tibetan region’s remoteness and inaccessibility. Moreover Buddhism has sturdy influence on Tibetan culture since its introduction in the 7th century. In Tibet art, literature and music all contain elements of prevailing Buddhist beliefs.

                                        Tibetan art is drawing the attention of all visitors. Tibetan art is guided by Yama, Dharmapala, the lord of death and Buddhism, which is deeply religious in nature. Tibetan art is influenced by three religious streams: Mahayana Buddhist influence, Tantric influence, Bön influence, Tibetan art is more influenced by other sacred art such as Thangkas painting, a syncretism of Chinese scroll painting and Nepalese and Kashmiri painting. They appeared in rectangular shape and painted on cotton or linen. They are usually traditional pattern depicting religious, astrological and theological subjects.

                                        Another attraction in Tibet Tour is for its visitors is Tibetan architecture, which contains Chinese and Indian influences, and reflects a deeply Buddhist approach. The Buddhist prayer wheel, along with two deer or dragons, can be seen on nearly every Gompa in Tibet. The design of the Tibetan Chörtens can diverge, from roundish walls in Kham to squarish, four-sided walls in Ladakh. The most unusual feature of Tibetan architecture is that many of the houses and monasteries are built on elevated, sunny sites facing the south, and are often made out a mixture of rocks, wood, cement and earth. Little fuel is available for heat or lighting, so flat roofs are built to preserve heat, and multiple windows are constructed to let in sunlight. Walls are usually sloped inwards at 10 degrees as a safety measure against frequent earthquakes in the mountainous area. The best example of Tibetan architecture is potala palace, former residence of Dalai Lama. It covers over thousand rooms within thirteen stories. And this Palace is designated as a UNESCO’ world heritage site in 1994. Other attractive architectural monasteries can be seen all over the Tibet.

                                        Tibet is also famous for its festivals such as Loshar, Shoton, and the Bathing Festival, which are deeply rooted in indigenous religion, and also contain foreign influences. Each person takes part in the Bathing Festival three times: at birth, at marriage, and at death. It is traditionally believed that people should not bathe casually, but only on the most important occasions. Tibetan festivals are a high source of entertainment and can include many sports such as Yak racing. Tour expert of Ecological trek has designed Tibet tour itineraries.
