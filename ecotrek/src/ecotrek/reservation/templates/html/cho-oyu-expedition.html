                                        <b>Chooyu(8201m.)</b> is the world’s sixth highest mountain situated in the Nepal Tibet border. This mountain is located in the Khumbu sub section of the Mahalangur Himalayan 20 km west of Mount Everest. Just a few kilometers west of ChoOyu there is Nangpa La (5,716m.), a glaciated pass that serves as the main trading route between the Tibetans and the Khumbu's Sherpas. This pass separates the Khumbu and Rolwaling Himalayas. Due to its proximity to this pass and the generally moderate slopes of the standard northwest ridge route, ChoOyu is considered the easiest 8,000 meter peak to climb. ChoOyu was first climbed on October 19, 1954, via the north-west ridge by Herbert Tichy, Joseph Jöchler and Sherpa Pasang Dawa Lama of an Austrian Expedition.

                                        Though <b>ChoOyu Expedition</b> is not technical one, it still demand some mountaineering experience because you will need to climb on steep, near vertical ice for 25 meters and on a similar steep rock section, both with fixed ropes, traverse hard ice on a fixed rope and abseil down these section several times. So, before going ChoOyu Expedition it will better for anyone to go above 6000m adventurous peak climbing which will give all the necessary experiences for this Mountain Expedition. Vehicle is access to <b>ChoOyu Base Camp</b> so we will reach to its base camp through drive on the way we will pass beautiful places such as Zhamu, Nyalam and Tingri. From ChoOyu Base Camp, expedition begins and after the several days successful effort we will finally reach to ChoOyu summit. ChoOyu Summit offers stunning glimpse of the towering white capped peaks and beautiful landscape of the Tibet. After rewarding the natural beautiful scenery of the region we will return to Kathmandu via same route.
