And it is the sources of three mighty rivers: Indus, Brahmaputra and Karnali Tibetan Buddhists believe Kang Rinpoche, which means Precious Snow Mountain, is a natural Mandala representing the Buddhist cosmology on the earth and the Jain believe that this is the place where their religion's founder was spiritually awakened. In Hinduism, it is considered to be the abode of Lord Shiva and a place of eternal bliss. This mount Kailash is a representation of his home, as actual Shivalaya (Home of Shiva Mahadev) is different.
