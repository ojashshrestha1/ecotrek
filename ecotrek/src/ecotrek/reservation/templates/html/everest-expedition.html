                                        As the tallest mountain of the world <b>Mt Everest Expedition</b> is most challenging, courageous, adventurous and risky expedition of the world. Each and every mountaineer wants to go on Everest Expedition at least once in their life. When for the first time Sir Edmund Hillary and Tensing Norgay Sherpa climbed Mt. Everest in May 1953 then way to Mt. Everest was opened for all the Mountaineers. Since then, <b>Mt Everest</b> has been successfully climbed by many mountaineers around the world. Beside this successful story of Mt Everest expedition there are also some tragic stories attached with it. Many mountaineers frequently lost their life during the journey because of bad weather, physical weakness and lack of necessary experience on expedition. So, if you chose Everest Expedition for its challenging, courageous and adventurous feature then you should not forget about its risky and dangerous feature. Before going on Everest expedition you must have extensive mountaineering experience of climbing expedition at least 6,000 meters mixed with a multitude of alpine mountaineering and, preferably 8000m peaks in Himalayas. Although fixed ropes will be used, Everest expeditionâ€™s members must be able to ascend and descend fixed lines independently and be expert balancing on steep ice or snow slopes. Though Everest expedition is difficult and risky but when you will reach on the top of the peak 8848m, highest place of the earth, you will forget all the difficulties and stay awhile with great proud of being on the top of the world. Amusing glimpse from the top of the world make you forget that I have to go down with the same difficult of climbing. Once if you go on Everest expedition, unforgettable experience with top of the world strikes you forever as never ending journey.  .
