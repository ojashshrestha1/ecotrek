                                      <b>Manaslu Mountain 80163m</b> is the 8th highest peak in the world located in the Gorkha, district western region of Nepal. Interms of mountain expedition this mountain is considered one of the most dangerous Mountains in the world and often called killer Mountain. <b>Manaslu Expedition </b>is the new challenge for the mountaineers and manaslu expedition can be taken as a training expedition for the Mt. Everest expedition. The trips of Manaslu Expedition trip starts with a flight from Kathmandu to Samagon, a developing green village of Gorkha district. And journey from this village to Manaslu Base Camp is really romantic because this area is filling-up with the Rhodododendron trees, wonderful hanging glaciers and rugged icefalls. The Mt. Manaslu Base Camp is often surrounded with heavy cloud and snowfalls. After walking of one hour there is another point called Larkya glacier. To reach camp 1 it takes in about three from Larkya glacier. To reach in camp 2 it takes nearly six hours and this camp 2 is fill-up with heavy ice falls. It takes another 3-4 hours to climb from camp 2 to camp 3. This camp 3 is popular for the romantic glimpse of surrounding peaks. But be aware this place is so cold with strong winds. From this camp 3 you need to climb approximately four to five hours to reach the camp 4, the area of upper snow slope and short ice bulges. You will reach your final destination of this expedition within approximately 7-8 hours from this camp four. Now you are on the summit of Mt. Manaslu enjoy awhile there. And the descending is fast and easy in contrast to climbing. As this trip is very weather dependent for flying to the Samagon and snow dependent on the mountain expedition, so it is better  to arrive relatively early after the monsoon to take advantage of clear and calm periods.
